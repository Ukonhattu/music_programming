This repository uses some util functions made by Kai Lassfolk. I don't have lincense for those files so I cannot publish them here.

## Usage
There are two different filters: 63 degree fir and second degree iir.

To use fir:
`make simple_fir`
`./simple_fir source destination`

To use iir:
`make simple_iir`
`./simple_iir source destination`
